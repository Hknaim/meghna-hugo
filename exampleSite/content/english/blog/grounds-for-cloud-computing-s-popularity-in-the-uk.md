Cloud Computing is a regular phrase for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the internet. It is one of the branches of computer science that covers the management, storage, and processing of data on a network of remote internet servers. Moreover, [Cloud Computing](https://ahzassociates.co.uk/msc-cloud-computing-in-the-uk/) is the future of information storage. The main objective of Cloud Computing is to make companies build large server rooms to securely store their data.

**History of Cloud Computing**

Since the early 2000s Cloud Computing has been introduced as a term. However, the concept of Cloud Computing is much old. The services of ‘time-sharing’ were largely overtaken by the rise of the PC which made owning a computer much more affordable and then in turn by the rise of corporate data centers where companies would store vast amounts of data.

**Importance of Cloud Computing**

According to the research of IDC, building the infrastructure to support Cloud Computing now accounts for more than a third of all IT spending globally. At the same time, while spending on traditional, in-house IT continues to slide as computing workloads continue to move to the cloud, whether that is public cloud services offered by vendors or private clouds built by enterprises themselves.

**Category of Cloud Computing**

This service has been divided into three categories. Such as,

● **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** It is the most open-minded type of cloud service for organizations. The organizations that use this cloud want to do a lot of customization. The most advantage of this cloud is its extra capacity.

● **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** This cloud uses to build blocks for creating software including development tools. The vendors take care of the back-end concerns. Such as security, infrastructure with PaaS. As a result, the users can focus on building, hosting, or testing apps faster and at a lower cost.

● **Software as a Service (SaaS):** It is the common type of cloud compared to the other two and it delivers complete applications over the internet. It does not require a lot of time to save technical staff as the users do not need to download or install on each individual’s computer.

**Types of Cloud Computing**

1. **Public Cloud:** This is a type of cloud computing in which the cloud service providers make computing resources. Moreover, these resources might be accessible to everyone without spending a single penny or the access might be sold on the basis of subscription-based or pay based on the use. Over the past few years, the international market for public cloud computing has grown rapidly.
2. **Private Cloud:** This cloud is made only for one user and the access of it is kept highly restricted. Private cloud gets many of the benefits of cloud computing. Such as elasticity, scalability, and ease of service delivery.
3. **Hybrid Cloud:** The main objective of this cloud is to establish a mix of public and private clouds. The characteristics of a hybrid cloud can be complicated and confusing. Also, the requirements can differ according to the users

**Advantages of Cloud Computing**

The advantages of cloud computing are:

● If the data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to get back up and restore that file from the cloud.

● The applications of the cloud develop its collaboration by allowing groups of people to quickly and easily share information.

● Users can easily access the information stored in the cloud by using an internet connection.

● Organizations can reduce their hardware and software costs by using the cloud.

● One of the biggest benefits of cloud computing is the security of data. Cloud offers some advanced features to its user to protect their valuable data and documents.

**Disadvantages of Cloud Computing**

The disadvantages of cloud computing are:

● As the data is stored in the cloud, you cannot access them without having an internet connection.

● The users may face problems while moving their services from one vendor to another as different vendors provide different platforms.

● The cloud users have less control over the function as the infrastructure is completely owned, managed, and monitored by the service provider.

**Study Cloud Computing in the United Kingdom**

The UK universities that offer Cloud Computing degrees are:

● University of Leeds

● Newcastle University

● Nottingham Trent University

● University of Leicester

● Middlesex University

In the end, if you are interested in BSc/ MSc in IT Security and want to demonstrate your career in this field then one of these universities will be the foremost destination for you.
